          I just wanted to say thank you. Like actually thank you.
          <br><br>
          Being long distance isn’t always easy, but you make it feel lighter. You show up for me in ways that matter. You’re patient with the time difference, you check on me, you listen to me, you stay soft with me even when life is stressful. And somehow, even from far away, you still make me feel loved and cared for.
          <br><br>
          I appreciate you more than I can explain. I appreciate your heart, your effort, your loyalty, your sense of humor, the way you understand me without me having to say everything perfectly. I swear even on the days I'm tired or not feeling like myself, you still bring me peace. You’re my safe place, and it’s kind of crazy that you can do that from miles away.
          <br><br>
          And honestly, I'm so excited to see you for valentine’s day. I’ve been counting down. I'm taking this flight because I don’t want to just say “I miss you” anymore, I want to be with you. I want to hold you, look at you properly, kiss you, and just exist next to you. I want to make you feel how loved you are, in real life, not just through a screen.
          <br><br>
          Thank you for choosing me and choosing us. I'm really lucky I get to call you mine.
          <br><br>
          Happy valentine’s day, my special girl. I'm coming to you with the fullest heart.
          <br><br>
          Love you always,
          <br>
